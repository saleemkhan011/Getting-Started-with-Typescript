// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”



let cars = ['Civic','Mercedes','Ferrari'];
let statement='I would like to own a';
console.log(statement,cars[0]);
console.log(statement,cars[1]);
console.log(statement,cars[2]);


// Another Method:

/* for (let car of cars){
     console.log(`${statement} ${car}`);
 }   */
